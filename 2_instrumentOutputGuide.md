# Instrument Output Guide

To enable future use of the data it is recommended that the complete instrument output is included in the dataset, noting the following:

-   This may be included as either compiled files containing all data variables, or the original individual files downloaded from the instrument.

-   There is no requirement to edit column headers in complete instrument output files to standard variable names.

-   The quality control level should be indicated in the methods metadata file.

-   Data description files for LI-COR instruments are provided in [templates] and should be included if applicable.
    These files include output variables in standard leaf gas exchange operations for LI-COR 6800 (software and manual v2.1) and LI-COR 6400 XT (software v.6.3.4 and manual v6.2).
    These files can be modified to include any User Defined variables presented in your data files.
    Data description files for other instruments may be added to this repository as available (if you would like to contribute a data description for a different instrument, please let us know by posting an Issue).
